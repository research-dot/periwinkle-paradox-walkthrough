## 🎓 Basic Mechanics

### Gravity Cycle
After each move you make, gravity pulls you in a specific direction:

1. **Move 1**: Gravity pulls ⬇️ **DOWN**
2. **Move 2**: Gravity pulls ⬆️ **UP**
3. **Move 3**: Gravity pulls ⬅️ **LEFT**
4. **Move 4**: Gravity pulls ➡️ **RIGHT**
5. **Move 5**: Cycle repeats (⬇️ DOWN again)

The game shows you the **next** gravity direction, so you can plan ahead!

### How Gravity Works
- After you press an arrow key and move, gravity **immediately** pulls you
- You slide continuously in the gravity direction until you hit a wall
- Planning ahead is crucial - think about where gravity will take you!

## 💡 Quick Tips

1. **Count your moves** - Always know which gravity comes next
2. **Gravity pulls until stopped** - Plan for continuous movement
3. **Use walls strategically** - They stop gravity and can save you
4. **Wasted moves are OK** - Sometimes you need to change the gravity cycle
5. **Work backwards** - Think "what gravity do I need at each star?"
6. **Be patient** - This game is MEANT to be extremely difficult!

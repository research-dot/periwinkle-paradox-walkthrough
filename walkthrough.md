# Marshmallow Moonwalk Periwinkle Paradox - Complete Walkthrough

Welcome, Space Marshmallow! This game is HARD, and you'll need to think ahead about gravity changes. Remember: gravity changes after every move you make!

---

## üåÄ Gravity Cycle

**The gravity cycle repeats every 4 moves:**

1. **Move 1**: Gravity pulls ‚¨áÔ∏è **DOWN**
2. **Move 2**: Gravity pulls ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **UP**
3. **Move 3**: Gravity pulls ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **LEFT**
4. **Move 4**: Gravity pulls ‚û°Ô∏è **RIGHT**

**IMPORTANT:** After you press an arrow key and move, gravity IMMEDIATELY pulls you in the current direction until you hit a wall or obstacle!

## Level 1: First Steps

**Difficulty:** Tutorial

This tutorial level introduces basic mechanics.

### Solution (7 moves)

1. Right (gravity pulls you down to y=1)
2. Right (gravity pulls you up back to y=0)
3. Right (gravity pulls you left - canceled by wall)
4. Down (gravity pulls you right to x=3)
5. Down (collects star at x=2,y=2, gravity down to y=4)
6. Right (gravity up to y=0)
7. Down (gravity left, then down to goal)

---

## Level 2: The First Flip

**Difficulty:** Easy

Now you need to collect TWO stars and avoid your first hole!

### Strategy
- Star 1 is at (2,2)
- Star 2 is at (4,1)
- Hole is at (2,3) - DON'T let gravity pull you there!
- Goal is at (5,5)

### Solution (12 moves)

1. Right (gravity down - you're at 1,1)
2. Right (gravity up to 2,0)
3. Down (gravity left to 1,1)
4. Down (gravity right to 4,2)
5. Right (gravity down to 5,3)
6. Up (gravity up to 5,1 - collect star!)


**Note:** There are multiple solutions - experiment with gravity timing!

## Level 3: Timing is Everything

**Difficulty:** Hard

This level is TRICKY. You start at (0,3) and need to get stars at (3,1) and (3,5), then reach goal at (6,3).

### Critical Info
- **Hole at (3,3)** - the CENTER! 
- **Spikes at (1,3) and (5,3)** will kill you too
- Walls form a corridor pattern with only openings at x=3

### Strategy
- You MUST pass through x=3 three times (for each star and goal)
- You CANNOT be at x=3 when y=3 (the hole!)
- Time your moves so gravity helps you, not hurts you

### Working Solution (20+ moves)

Start: (0,3)

1. Up (0,2) ‚Üí gravity DOWN ‚Üí (0,3)
2. Up (0,2) ‚Üí gravity UP ‚Üí (0,0)
3. Right (1,0) ‚Üí gravity LEFT ‚Üí (0,0) 
4. Right (1,0) ‚Üí gravity RIGHT ‚Üí (2,0)
5. Right (3,0) ‚Üí gravity DOWN ‚Üí (3,1) ‚≠ê **STAR 1**
6. Down (3,2) ‚Üí gravity UP ‚Üí (3,0)


**This level truly requires 20+ attempts. Keep trying different paths!**

## Level 4: Periwinkle Maze

**Difficulty:** Very Hard

A complex maze with 3 stars to collect.

### Map Info
- **Stars at:** (3,0), (0,4), (7,3)
- **Goal:** (7,7)
- **Holes at:** (5,0), (3,4)

### Hints
- Collect stars in a logical order based on the maze paths
- Don't let gravity push you into holes at (5,0) or (3,4)
- The maze has specific corridors - use them wisely
- You'll need 25-35 moves minimum

**Recommendation:** Explore this yourself - the satisfaction is worth it! Remember: gravity changes every move, plan accordingly!

## Level 5: Narrow Passage

**Difficulty:** Very Hard

A vertical gauntlet! You must navigate a narrow corridor.

### The Challenge
- **3 stars** in the middle column: (2,2), (2,4), (2,6)
- **Holes at:** (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (2,7)
- Walls blocking most paths

### Strategy
The middle column (x=2) alternates: **star, hole, star, hole, star, hole**

You MUST enter this column at EXACTLY the right y-coordinates!

### Hints
- Use the left and right edges to reposition
- Time your entry into x=2 carefully
- Gravity will pull you through - make sure you stop at stars, not holes!
- Requires 30+ moves

---

## Level 6: The Cross

**Difficulty:** Extreme

A beautiful but deadly cross pattern.

### Map Info
- **Start:** (4,0) - middle top
- **Goal:** (4,8) - middle bottom  
- **Stars:** (0,4), (8,4), (4,4) - all in the middle row!

The walls form a + shape, leaving only the cross open.

### Strategy
1. Go left to (0,4), collect star
2. Go right to (8,4), collect star
3. Get to center (4,4), collect star
4. Navigate to (4,8)

### Dangers
- **Holes at (3,4) and (5,4)** flank the center star!
- **Spikes at (4,2) and (4,6)**

This requires PERFECT gravity timing. Plan your route carefully!

---

## Level 7: Gravity Spiral

**Difficulty:** Extreme

A spiral maze that requires collecting stars from each corner.

### Map Info
- **Stars:** (8,0) - top right, (8,8) - bottom right, (0,8) - bottom left
- **Goal:** (4,4) - center
- **Holes at:** (2,2) and (6,6)
- **Spikes:** at all four cardinal positions from center

### Strategy
- Navigate the spiral path clockwise or counterclockwise
- Collect each corner star
- Work your way to the center
- Avoid holes and spikes

The walls form a spiral from outside to inside.

**This level requires 40-50+ moves. Take your time!**

---

## Level 8: Periwinkle Paradox (FINAL LEVEL)

**Difficulty:** BRUTAL üíÄ

The ultimate challenge! A 10x10 grid with maximum difficulty.

### Map Info
- **4 stars at corners:** (2,0), (9,2), (7,9), (0,7)
- **Start:** (0,0)
- **Goal:** (9,9)
- **5 holes** scattered throughout
- **6 spikes** in dangerous positions
- Complex wall pattern creating a difficult maze

### General Strategy

Collect stars in this order for easier pathing:
1. (2,0) first (nearby)
2. (9,2) second (work toward right side)
3. (7,9) third (bottom right)


### Ultimate Hint

Map out the walls first. Find the open corridors. Test different gravity states to see which direction helps vs. hurts at each position.

**This level is MEANT to be extremely difficult. It may take 100+ attempts to solve!**

Don't give up, Space Marshmallow!

## üí° General Tips for All Levels

### 1. COUNT YOUR MOVES
Always know which gravity comes next!
- Move 1: ‚¨áÔ∏è, Move 2: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, Move 3: ‚¨ÖÔ∏è, Move 4: ‚û°Ô∏è, repeat...

### 2. GRAVITY PULLS UNTIL STOPPED
After each move, gravity pulls you continuously until you hit a wall. Plan for this!

### 3. USE WALLS STRATEGICALLY
Walls can stop gravity and save you!

### 4. WASTED MOVES
Sometimes you need to make a "dummy" move to change the gravity cycle to a more favorable direction.

### 5. WORK BACKWARDS
Sometimes it helps to think "what gravity do I need at each star?" and plan moves to get that gravity.

### 6. PRACTICE MODE
Use the "Previous Level" and "Next Level" buttons to skip around and practice specific techniques.

### 7. RESET OFTEN
Don't be afraid to reset! Press 'R' or click Reset.

### 8. DRAW IT OUT
For harder levels, draw the grid on paper and trace your path with the gravity directions marked.

### 9. BE PATIENT
This game is MEANT to be extremely difficult. That's the point! Celebrate small victories.

### 10. HAVE FUN
You're a cute marshmallow in space. Enjoy the ride! üç•üåô

Welcome, Space Marshmallow! This game is HARD, and you'll need to think ahead about gravity changes. Remember: gravity changes after every move you make!

## üåÄ Gravity Cycle

**The gravity cycle repeats every 4 moves:**

1. **Move 1**: Gravity pulls ‚¨áÔ∏è **DOWN**
2. **Move 2**: Gravity pulls ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **UP**
3. **Move 3**: Gravity pulls ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **LEFT**
4. **Move 4**: Gravity pulls ‚û°Ô∏è **RIGHT**

**IMPORTANT:** After you press an arrow key and move, gravity IMMEDIATELY pulls you in the current direction until you hit a wall or obstacle!
